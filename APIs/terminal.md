## Terminal commands

- killall node (kills all active node terminals; could only be applicable for Apple PCs?)

## Git commands
- git log (shows the last commit history; sorted by time/date committed)
- git revert {601e2affb5fca3addd898cb09ef950c562338823} (601..etc is a placeholder commit hash; reverts a commit by a particular hash value; use git log to get desired hash)
- git revert HEAD (reverts the most recent commit; more useful)
